# Signal & Image Processing Virtual Lab (HTML/CSS Project)

This project is a conceptual **Signal & Image Processing Virtual Laboratory** created to practice and demonstrate core **HTML and CSS** web-development skills.  
The lab does **not** exist in reality; it serves as an academic exercise to simulate how a research or teaching lab website might look.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project
- Apply foundational **HTML & CSS** concepts  
- Practice front-end structure, layout design, and UI organization  
- Create a clean, academic-style interface for a fictional laboratory  
- Demonstrate multi-page static website development skills
